# MyReads Project

## Project Overview:

The objective was to implement React's component capabilities to the static reading list app. In doing so, the hard coded portions were broken up into components for a cleaner and interactive functioning app.

### Running the Project

Once the projects files have been obtained by either clone or zip and stored on local drive:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## How it Works
The main page lets you sort books into three different shelves. Books can also be moved from one shelve to another and be removed entirely. To search for more books including the ones removed, there is a search page that renders the books that match the characters as they are typed into the search bar. These books can then be added to the appropriate shelf.

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

Udacity provided a backend server for development. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)
